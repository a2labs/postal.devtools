postal.devtools
===============

A extension for Google Chrome that allows you to view postal messages and interact with the message bus.

_Disclaimer: This is an appendTo Labs project and as such there is no promise of support or even future development of this project. We are working on this project to meet a need at appendTo and sharing it in the spirit of open source software. If it helps you or your team meet needs as well, that is awesome â€“ however, use at your own risk._

**This was a hacky attempt at getting this to work to do some debugging, over time this needs to be cleaned up**

## Features that would be great to add:

* Ability to edit and replay messages
* Ability to send custom messages
* Ability to filter the list by channel and/or topic

## Usage

To use this extension (after loading it into Google Chrome via the Development Tools option on the extension page), you need to add code into your app to allow this extension to access your postal instance:

```javascript
window._postalWireTapMessages = [];
postal.addWireTap( function ( data, env ) {
	window._postalWireTapMessages.push( JSON.stringify({ data: data, env: env }) );
});
```

Currently the application polls that variable for changes.
